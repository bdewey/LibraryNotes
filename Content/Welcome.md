#  Welcome to Library Notes

Library Notes is an iOS notes app inspired by *Commonplace Books*: places where to record thoughts and quotes about the things you read. Library Notes is not for quick, transient, *scrap paper* notes. It's a place to write things that will be meaningful to you for a long time.

> A commonplace book is a central resource or depository for ideas, quotes, anecdotes, observations and information you come across during your life and didactic pursuits. The purpose of the book is to record and organize these gems for later use in your life, in your business, in your writing, speaking or whatever it is that you do. (Ryan Holiday, *How and Why to Keep a "Commonplace Book"*).

What makes Library Notes different from other notes apps is its *review mode*. Review mode scans your notes for quotes, prompt questions, and cloze deletions. It prompts you with this material to make sure you constantly refresh your memory with all of the great things you've been capturing.

## How to use Library Notes

## Review mode

Library Notes's main difference from other applications is *review mode*. A single review mode session consists of up to 20 *prompts* extracted from your notes, and the goal is to refresh your memory about the things you have recorded.

Here's how Library Notes finds prompts:

1. **Quotes.** One of the most common thing to record in a Commonplace Book are quotes that you find meaningful. Library Notes may prompt you with any of the quotes you have recorded to see if you can remember its source.
2. **Cloze deletions.** You can tell Library Notes to remove a word or phrase from any quote or list item. It will prompt you to see if you can remember the phrase. This is called ?[what?](cloze deletion), and it uses this syntax: `?[hint](phrase to remove)`
3. **Question-and-answer prompts.** You can write your own questions and answers in your notes that will serve as prompts later. This is particulary helpful when making notes on non-fiction books, where the prompts can help you remember some of the main ideas you have read. 

Q: What is the syntax for a question and answer prompt?
A: Two consecutive lines where the first starts with `Q:` and the second starts with `A:`.

When reviewing content, you tap once to reveal the response to the prompt. If you remembered correctly, swipe right. Otherwise, swipe left. Swipe down to end the session.

## Organizing your notes

Library Notes uses hashtags to organize your notes. Hashtags can be hierarchical, like so:
